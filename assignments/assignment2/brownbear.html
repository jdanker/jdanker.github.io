        <h2>The Grizzly Bear</h2>
       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>The Grizzly Bear is another bear that lives in North America. It has several subspecies such as the American Grizzly and Kodiak. The Grizzly can somewhat vary in size depending on
           the region it lives in. Brown bears near the coast tend to be large while the more inland groups tend to be smaller. The Grizzly can also hibernate from 5-7 months out of every year.
           Each year the females can produce up to 4 cubs.

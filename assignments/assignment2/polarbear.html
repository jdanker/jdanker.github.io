        <h2>The Polar Bear</h2>
       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>The Polar Bear primarily lives inside the Arctic Circle. It is a large bear, probabaly the largest of the 3 kinds of bears
        They spend most of their time on sea ice, looking for prey underneath the ice such as seals and fish. When there is limited food, Polar bears
        will survive off of their body fat for several weeks at a time. Polar Bears are the most aggressive out of the 3 major bear types. They tend to be
        stealthy when hunting their prey, and the victim is often unaware that the bear is there until they are about to be eaten.
